        <p>The people of Wardak Province are mostly Pashtuns who have a very old culture that most of its people still follow.</p>
        <p>One of its cultures is their old houses which are in the form of mud houses. In recent times, a mosque has been built in Dasht-e-Top which is one of the largest mosques in this province.</p>
        <p>Another culture of this province can be seen from helping each other in various rituals such as weddings, funerals, Eids in preparing food and distributing it to the people, where cooking shorwa and chapati bread is common in such ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Another culture that is common among all Pashtun people is giving a handkerchief designed with the handicrafts of Pashtun women from the bride's family to the groom's family. Also, their wedding ceremony lasts for a week and close friends and relatives perform various ceremonies during this period. The Aten dance is one of the most famous dances performed by the groom's sisters and brothers as well as the groom's very close relatives.</p>
        <p>Another thing that is customary in this province is that when collecting agricultural products, especially apples, which are very famous in this province, women help with their men in collecting them, and each house has a special room prepared to store their products. They store these products for up to a year.</p>
